# Kickstarting-with-Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use Excel to analyse data, from Kickstarter, on the outcomes of crowd funding for theater.  We were asked to answer two questions.  What were the outcomes of the crowd funding campaign based on launch date and what were the outcomes based on the goals.  The answers were found using piviot charts and graphs of the data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As we can seen in the graph above, when fundraising campaigns begain May there were far more successful outcomes verses failed outcomes then any other time of the year.  Campains started in December saw almost the exact same number of successes and failers.
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The results of this graph are very interesting.  We can see that the percentage of successful campaigns is higher then the percentage of failed campains when the fundraising goal is less then $15,000 and when it is between $33,000 and $42,000.  When the campaign goal is $45,000 there is 0% chance of success but if the goal is higher then that the chance of success increases slightly.  The highest chance for a successful campaign is when the goal is less then $1,000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most challanging part of this analysis for me implamenting the "countifs()" function. After reviewing the hint and some help from Google I was able to work that part out and compleat the challage.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-- The best month the start a campaign is in May.
-- The worst month to start a campaign is in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-- You have a better chance of success if you ask for less then $5000 or between $35,000 and $40,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-- The dataset is limited by the amount of data avalible.  When there is not enough data the results can be skewed.  In the $45,000-$49,999 range there is only 1 data point.  That campaign was a failer so on the graph it shows that thers is no chance for success if you want to raise $45,000.  Having more data would give a person using this chart to plan their own campaign a more realistic chance.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
--Another graph that would give us some meaningful results would be a graph that shows the percentage of successful campaigns as it relates to different subcatagories of theater.
